# svr, a STL-based library for scientific computing

## Introduction
This library stems from [the AUV project](https://github.com/vrsreeganesh/AUV). Therefore the contents of the library are more tuned for the computations for that project. However, owing to the inter-disciplinary nature of AUV, I would not be surprised if this has the potential to be used for general-purpose computing.

## Setup & Installation
- Clone this repository to the includes folder of your project. 
- "#include" the svr.hpp file in the main.cpp file

## Notes
Some classes/functions, like the ThreadPool class, is a wrapper for boost::asio::thread_pool with STL syntax and STL-namestyle functions.
